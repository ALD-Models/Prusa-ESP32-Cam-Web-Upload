# Getting Started

I would highly recommend that you take a look at the official instructions provided [here](https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware-ESP32-Cam/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#esp32-cam-ai-thinker-board).

# Uploading Code

Plug your ESP32 Cam into a USB port on your computer or laptop. Then visit: [https://ald-models.github.io/Prusa-ESP32-Cam-Web-Upload](https://ald-models.github.io/Prusa-ESP32-Cam-Web-Upload).

1. Select "Connect."
2. Choose the COM port that your ESP is connected to.
3. Press "Install Prusa Cam."
4. Press "Erase Device" to clear all saved memory (EEPROM).
5. Allow time for the upload to ESP32.
6. You're done!

# Security

We utilize the official release from the Prusa development page, which remains unaltered. Currently, I am in the process of establishing a link with the Prusa CAM GitHub release.
