# Getting Started

I would highly recommend that you take a look at the official instructions provided [here](https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware-ESP32-Cam/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#esp32-cam-ai-thinker-board).

# Uploading Code

Plug your ESP32 Cam into a USB port on your computer or laptop. Then visit: [https://ald-models.github.io/Prusa-ESP32-Cam-Web-Upload](https://ald-models.github.io/Prusa-ESP32-Cam-Web-Upload).

1. Select "Connect."
2. Choose the COM port that your ESP is connected to.
3. Press "Install Prusa Cam."
4. Allow time for the upload to ESP32.
5. You're done!

# Security

We utilize the official release from the Prusa development page, which remains unaltered. The firmware is automatically copied from the [Official Prusa Cam](https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware-ESP32-Cam/releases) release page at midnight everyday!
