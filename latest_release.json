The cache is valid for 24 hours, so it will automatically refresh after 24 hours.\r\n\r\n##  Added support of the jpg EXIF metadata\r\n---\r\nSupport for EXIF metadata for jpg images has been added. Thanks to this, it is possible to rotate the camera image by 0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees. The OV2640 camera module does not generate EXIF metadata. Therefore, it is necessary to calculate the EXIF metadata and add it to the image. The library for generating EXIF metadata is taken from user @dimhoff from his project [ESP32-CAM_Interval](https://github.com/dimhoff/ESP32-CAM_Interval). **EXIF metadata is not currently added for the stream**\r\n\r\n![camera_screen](https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware-ESP32-Cam/assets/4459753/89dd5801-8a8f-485c-ad5f-f49167078c67)\r\n\r\n##  Added TimeLaps function\r\n---\r\nIt is possible to enable saving the photos sent to Prusa Connect onto a micro SD card (formated to FAT32). Photos are saved on the micro SD card, in the folder **timelaps**. After successfully completing the print, it is necessary to remove the micro SD card from the camera and copy the saved photos from the card. The next, it is necessary to use SW to create a timelapse video from photos. \r\n\r\n## Added Micro SD card status and usage\r\n---\r\nThe status of the micro SD card and usage are displayed in the system page.\r\n\r\n![system_screen](https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware-ESP32-Cam/assets/4459753/cda42eb3-68f1-46d8-955e-93d2ecf00e44)\r\n\r\n##  Changed ESPAsyncWebServer library\r\n---\r\n\r\nInitially, the ESPAsyncWebsrv library by user [dvarrel](https://github.com/dvarrel/ESPAsyncWebSrv) was used. Currently is used another library, ESPAsyncWebServer by user [mathieucarbou](https://github.com/mathieucarbou/ESPAsyncWebServer). The new library has better stability according to tests, is more optimized, and is compatible with ESP-IDF 5.1.\r\n\r\n##  Change of logging to the file\r\n---\r\n\r\nLogging to a file on the micro SD card has been improved. Thanks to this, RAM memory is more optimized, and the speed and stability of the firmware are increased.\r\n\r\n## Added title of the page configuration\r\n---\r\nThe mDNS record is simultaneously used as the title for the camera's web page in the browser. Currently, mDNS is used for three functions:\r\n\r\n- mDNS record\r\n- Camera name in Prusa Connect\r\n- Browser title\r\n\r\n![mdns title](https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware-ESP32-Cam/assets/4459753/95ea16ea-eac8-471a-aa74-a4273cb35dc5)\r\n\r\n## Added button to start the live-stream\r\n---\r\n\r\nAdded a button on the webpage below Download snapshot to open the live-stream URL, improving accessibility. Thanks @Anheledir \r\n\r\n![stream button](https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware-ESP32-Cam/assets/4459753/7df9c1d4-8011-4211-9e7e-50f5a16d054b)\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes and web design improvement\r\n---\r\n- Several other bugs have been fixed and the WEB design has been improvement.\r\n- On the camera website, there is a change in the name of the tabs from\r\n    - Camera Configuration -> Camera\r\n    - Wi-Fi  Configuration -> Wi-Fi\r\n - Improvment camera flash functionality",
